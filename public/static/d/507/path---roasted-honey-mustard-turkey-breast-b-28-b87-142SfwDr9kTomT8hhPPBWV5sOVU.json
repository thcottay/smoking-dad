Nearly all of my grilling is inspired by Meathead’s methods. The ribs were dry-brined, rubbed, smoked, cut, and brought to a party. They were a hit!</p>\n<h2>The ribs</h2>\n<p>This paricular cut of ribs was purchased from Sam’s Club. They’re labeled “Pork Baby Back Ribs” and come in a vacuum sealed pack with three full slabs. This day they ran at $2.88/lb and at 8.45lb they rang in at $24.34. As soon as I brought them home from the store, I removed the membrane from the back to encourage tenderness. In this cook, I smoked two of the slabs and saved one for another day.</p>\n<h2>Marinading the turkey</h2>\n<h2>The cook</h2>\n<p>This cut of turkey went on the grill at 12:30pm. It was set at 350 degrees, but with winter temperatures in the teens, the temp hovered around 310-330 degrees.</p>\n<p>1 hour in it was at 105 degrees. The ribs reached 165 at 2:30pm, for a total time on the grill at 2 hours.</p>\n<h3>Donec hendrerit laoreet risus eget adipiscing.</h3>\n<p>Nullam eros mi, mollis in sollicitudin non, tincidunt sed enim.
