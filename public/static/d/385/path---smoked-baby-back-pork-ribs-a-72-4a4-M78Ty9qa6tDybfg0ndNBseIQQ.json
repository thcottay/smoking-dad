Meathead’s content is fantastic and highly recommended. Take a look at his <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Meathead-Science-Great-Barbecue-Grilling/dp/054401846X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1550508980&#x26;sr=8-1&#x26;keywords=meathead+the+science+of+great+barbecue+and+grilling\">book</a> as well. The ribs were dry-brined, rubbed, smoked, cut, and devoured.</p>\n<h2>The ribs</h2>\n<p>This paricular cut of ribs was purchased from Sam’s Club. They’re labeled “Pork Baby Back Ribs” and come in a vacuum sealed pack with three full slabs. This day they ran at $2.88/lb and at 8.45lb they rang in at $24.34. As soon as I brought them home from the store, I removed the membrane from the back to encourage tenderness. In this cook, I smoked two of the slabs and saved one for another day.</p>\n<h2>Seasoning the ribs</h2>\n<p>The night before this particular smoke, I salted the ribs using plain Morton’s Table Salt. The amount was unscientific - I sprinked them with roughly the amount I would use if I was salting any other food I was about to eat. They went back into the fridge to allow the salt to absorb overnight.</p>\n<p>The next day just prior to throwing them on the smoker, I dry rubbed them with a generous amount of home made <a href=\"https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/spice-rubs-and-pastes/meatheads-memphis-dust-rub-recipe\">Memphis Dust</a>, a dry rub that calls for lots of paprika and sugars.</p>\n<h2>The smoke</h2>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b93e8e812743bbc52741dc5e4d402079/bff80/ribs-cooked.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px transparent;\"\n        alt=\"unsplash.com\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/b93e8e812743bbc52741dc5e4d402079/78f2b/ribs-cooked.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b93e8e812743bbc52741dc5e4d402079/dce19/ribs-cooked.jpg 200w,\n/static/b93e8e812743bbc52741dc5e4d402079/c1413/ribs-cooked.jpg 400w,\n/static/b93e8e812743bbc52741dc5e4d402079/78f2b/ribs-cooked.jpg 800w,\n/static/b93e8e812743bbc52741dc5e4d402079/ab4c4/ribs-cooked.jpg 1200w,\n/static/b93e8e812743bbc52741dc5e4d402079/bc99b/ribs-cooked.jpg 1600w,\n/static/b93e8e812743bbc52741dc5e4d402079/34a60/ribs-cooked.jpg 2400w,\n/static/b93e8e812743bbc52741dc5e4d402079/bff80/ribs-cooked.jpg 4032w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>The ribs went on the smoker at 10:30am.
