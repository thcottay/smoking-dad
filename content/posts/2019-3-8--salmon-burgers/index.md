![Honey Mustard Roasted Turkey Breast](./IMG_7519.jpg)

This cook was a highly modified version of [Bobby Flay's Roasted Whole Turkey Breast](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/tandoori-style-roasted-whole-turkey-breast-recipe-2009477) recipe.

## The Meat
The bone-in Honeysuckle White turkey breast was purchased from Schnuck's frozen and thawed in the refrigerator for 1 week. It weighed 6.76 pounds and at $2.89 per pound, its total price was $19.54.

## Marinading the Turkey
To marinade the turkey breast, I mixed 3/4 cups of hellman's mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons of pepper, 2 tablespoons of salt, 2 tablespoons of onion powder, 2 tablespoons of garlic pepper, 4 tablespoons of mustard and 4 tablespoons of honey. Amounts represent rough estimates that weren't really measured.

## The Cook

This cut of turkey went on the grill at 12:30pm. It was set at 350 degrees, but with winter temperatures in the teens, the temp hovered around 310-330 degrees. Two hours later it reached the 165 degrees internally. It was removed rested for 30 minutes, and was sliced and served. Delicious!
