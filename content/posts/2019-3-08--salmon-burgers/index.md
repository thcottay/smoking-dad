This cook was a modified version of the Food Network's <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/perfect-salmon-burgers-recipe-2105786" target="_blank">Perfect Salmon Burgers</a> recipe. I used ingredients that I had on hand as substitutions to the recipe when needed. These were a fantastic alternative to regular beef burgers, and the toddler loved them.

## The Fish

For this recipe, I used two packages of Alid's Sea Queen Wild Caught Pink Salmon Filets. These come in frozen, boneless, skin-off filets in 1 pound packages. These are relatively inexpensive when compared to fresh salmon, so they were perfect for grinding into burgers. 

## Turning the Salmon into Burgers

In a food processor, I added the two pounds of pre-cut and skinned salmon filets, two tablespoons of miracle whip, two tablespoons of regular mustard, one tablespoon of ground black pepper, a half cup of italian breadcrumbs, and a few pinches of salt. After combining these ingredients, I set the blender to pulse for 10-30 seconds, stopped and stirred, and repeated four or so times.

I placed the burgers on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seen-Yoshi-Grill-Bake-Copper/dp/B01N12MIH5/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1553194449&refinements=p_n_material_browse%3A316633011&s=kitchen&sr=1-1" target="blank">copper sheet</a>, so they wouldn't break apart or stick to the grill. I set my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKK552M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05__o00_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">Traeger Lil Texas Elite 22</a> to high, which translates to 400 degrees of indirect heat. I left them on the grill for 30 minutes, and flipped them once half way into the cook. The time may be less if cooked on a traditional grill on direct heat.

These were served like a normal burger - on a bun with pickles, lettuce, ketchup and mustard. Delicious!
